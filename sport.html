                        <p>At Tharlam Academy, sports play a vital role in the lives of our students. We are divided
                            into four houses that compete in a wide range of events, including football, kabaddi,
                            kho-kho, volleyball, relay races, and other recreational activities that refresh the mind
                            and build physical stamina. Football is especially beloved—many consider it the most
                            enjoyable and prestigious sport at our academy.</p>
                        <p>Tharlam Academy often organizes special football tournaments on occasions like birthdays
                            (“Birthday Cup”) and during Thuktea, a distinctive school holiday that’s more than just a
                            break—it’s a cherished time to recharge. These tournaments foster spirited competition,
                            camaraderie, and school pride.</p>

                            holistic approach, blending modern education, physical wellbeing, and traditional values.
